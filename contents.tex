Dear prospective students,

Thank you for your interest in our department! 
The graduate students of the UC Berkeley Department of Nuclear Engineering have compiled this information packet to help you learn more about us---our student societies, our research groups, and our lives outside of school. 
We've included our contact information in this packet and you are welcome to contact any of us with questions about the department or Berkeley. 
We look forward to getting to know each one of you. 
\textit{Fiat lux} and go bears! \\
