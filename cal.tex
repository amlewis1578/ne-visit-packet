	The University is located at the base of the Berkeley hills, directly across the bay from San Francisco. 
	The San Francisco Bay Area offers a variety of cultural and entertainment activities. 
	Berkeley students can easily access the lively San Francisco and Oakland city centers, collaborate with top minds from Silicon Valley, explore the Bay's historic monuments like the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz, or hike in the abundant parks and nature preserves. 
	Weather in the Bay is mild year round: summers are foggy and cool, autumn brings a gentle dry heat, and winter hardly ever gets below freezing, though rain is common.
